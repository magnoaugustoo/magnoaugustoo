# 🚀 **Hi, I’m Magno Augusto**  
## 💻 **Front-End Developer | Clean Code Enthusiast | UX/UI Craftsman**

I don’t just build websites —  
**I design digital experiences** that are intuitive, elegant, and functional.

With a solid grasp of front-end technologies and an obsession with clarity and simplicity,  
**I aim to bridge the gap between design and development** — where every detail tells a story.

### 📚 **The Lab Is Active**
